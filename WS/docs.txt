HOW TO USE:
This section will define how to use the server I have programmed.

First things first you want to esablish a connection. You do this by connecting to the websocket and sending the LOGIN command.
This will create a new client account or access an old one that has been put in.

Then you will want to get the message history of a chat. This is done via the GET command, it will return all the chat history of the user.

After that you are good to start sending SEND commands to whoever you want to message. Messages are handled with usernames currently.


ECHO:
The server will send back what you send it
{
    "Type": "ECHO",
    "Message": "TEST"
}
This will return TEST back to the caller

LOGIN:
Will attempt to log in a user via a username. If there is no record of user, a new client account will be made. (Passwords can be added if wanted)
{
    "Type": "LOGIN",
    "Sender": "username1"
}
This will attempt to log in as the user "username1"

SEND:
Send a message from one user to another.
{
    "Type": "SEND",
    "Sender": "username1",
    "Recipient": "username2",
